# 🧪 SauceDemo Manual QA Testing Project

This project documents a **manual Quality Assurance (QA) testing process** performed on [SauceDemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com/), a sample e-commerce web application used for testing and training purposes.  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate structured QA practices — from **test planning** to **execution**, **bug reporting**, and **continuous improvement** — following industry-standard methodologies.

## ✅ Testing Approach

Testing was conducted using a combination of:
- **Functional Testing** – validating expected application behaviours.
- **Regression Testing** – verifying previously working features after fixes.
- **Exploratory Testing** – identifying potential usability issues beyond scripted test cases.
- **Boundary Testing** – checking limits of input fields and validation messages.

| Bug ID | Description | Severity | Status |
|--------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| BUG-001 | Login fails with valid credentials using Firefox | Major | Open |
| BUG-002 | Incorrect price total displayed in cart | Critical | Fixed |
| BUG-003 | Logout button misaligned on mobile view | Minor | Open |

## 📈 Key Learnings

- Reinforced structured manual QA process and documentation best practices.  
- Practised clear, reproducible bug reporting with evidence.  
- Gained insight into common e-commerce test flows (authentication, cart, checkout).  
- Improved use of Markdown and GitHub for professional portfolio presentation.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Expand coverage with **automated test cases** (using Playwright / Selenium).  
- Integrate with **Jira or TestRail** for formal test management.  
- Add **API testing** for backend validation using Postman or Python scripts.
